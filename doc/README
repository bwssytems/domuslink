  Troubleshooting
  ----------------
  1) Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent
  Edit you php.ini file (usually located within apache configuration dir)
  locate "output_buffering" and make sure it is set to "on".

  2) HEYU: Can't open TTY line. check permissions!
  Check apache/webserver user has permissions to use tty port.
  chmod o+rw /dev/tts/0 (for slackware/arch linux ttyS0 port)
  
  3) /etc/heyu/x10.conf not found or not readable! (or similar)
  First make sure permission's for the file are in fact correct, either 
  by setting the file owner/group to the webserver's user/group or by 
  giving read/write permission's to all. If problem persists edit your 
  php.ini file and make sure 'open_basedir' is disabled or that the 
  /etc/heyu directory is included.
