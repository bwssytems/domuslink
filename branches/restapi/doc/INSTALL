 Requirements:
 --------------
 To run and use domus.Link V1.2+ you need the following:
 
 These have been tested -
 - Heyu 2.8.0+
 - Apache 2.2+ (2.0+ may work if PHP5 is installed. Not Tested)
 - PHP5+ support
 
 
 Assumptions:
 --------------
 The following install procedure assumes the following:
 
 - Heyu is NOT running ($ [sudo] heyu stop )
 - Heyu configuration files are located in /etc/heyu
 - Heyu binary is located in /usr/local/bin
 - Websever root folder is /var/www
 - And domus.Link is being installed in /var/www/domus.Link
 
 
 Installation:
 --------------
 
 Note: Some commands that are shown may require root priveleges. Either become root on your system
 or pre-pend the command with sudo.

 1) Download latest version from http://domus.link.co.pt/download

 2) If upgrading from a previous version of domus.Link, backup existing domus.Link files. (VERY IMPORTANT)

    $ cp [your web path]/domus.Link/config.php [backup location]/config.php.backup
    $ cp -r [your web path]/domus.Link/db [backup location]
    
 3) Un-tar to a location within the webserver root or a specific directory.
 
 	These instructions show that /var/www is the web path for your server.
 
    $ cd /var/www
    $ tar xfvz [path to tar file]/domuslink-XXX.tar.gz

 4) Change file permission's so that webserver can read/write to the following files/dirs:
    - /etc/heyu
    - /var/www/domus.Link/db/ 
    - /var/www/domus.Link/config.php
    
    $ chmod o+rw /etc/heyu /var/www/domus.Link/db /var/www/domus.Link/config.php

 5) If upgrading from previous version, copy back backed up config.php.
 
 	$ cp [your backup location]/config.php.backup [your web path]/domus.Link/config.php
 	$ cp -r [your backup location]/db [your web path]/
 
 6) Setup apache accordingly, refer to http://httpd.apache.org if you don't
    know how to do this. Also see http://domus.link.co.pt HowTo's as well.
    
 7) Finally, point your web browser to your webserver (ie: http://localhost/domus.Link)
    and start heyu using the 'START' link located on the footer.

    If you are upgrading from a previous version of domus.Link prior to V1.2, you will be
    asked to convert your alias and floorplan to the new version. Click 'Convert' to
    accomplish this.
    If you click 'Continue', you will bypass the conversion and all aliases will be of type
    'other' and in location 'unknown'. While this action will not change your mapping, if you
    make a modification to the heyu config file in the admin area or update an alias, you will
    not be asked again for the convert. If you do not do anything and then start another session
    later, you will be asked for the conversion again.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The next step might not be required, however, if you keep getting a
 "HEYU: Can't open TTY line. check permissions!" then please follow it.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------


 X) Change permission on TTY port so that heyu can use it.
    
    The typically used port is /dev/ttyS0 which is usually a sym. link to
    /dev/tts/0 so in this case use the following command:
    
    $ chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS0
    
    To check where /dev/ttyS0 links to, issue the following command:
    
    $ ls -l /dev/ttyS0
