  Troubleshooting
  ----------------
  1) Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent
  Edit you php.ini file (usually located within apache configuration dir)
  locate "output_buffering" and make sure it is set to "on".

  2) HEYU: Can't open TTY line. check permissions!
  Check apache/webserver user has permissions to use tty port.
  chmod o+rw /dev/tts/0 (for slackware/arch linux ttyS0 port)
  
  3) /etc/heyu/x10.conf not found or not readable! (or similar)
  First make sure permission's for the file are in fact correct, either 
  by setting the file owner/group to the webserver's user/group or by 
  giving read/write permission's to all. If problem persists edit your 
  php.ini file and make sure 'open_basedir' is disabled or that the 
  /etc/heyu directory is included.
  
  4) When veiwing the home screen, all of my modules show in the 'unknown' location.
  You have a new instance of domus.Link and will need to assign the aliases to a
  loaction in the admin/alias screen. This is done by editing an alias and in the location
  drop down, typing in a new location as this field is editable.
  
  5) Error in saving config file, file has been modified.
  This occurs when another user or a manual edit has occured on a config filewhen you have
  tried to save a modification. In most instances the changes will be detected before
  this happens. If it does happen, exit your browser completely and try again.

  6) Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_OBJECT_OPERATOR in.....
  Domus.Link now requires PHP5+ as we use the php object model with multiple object operator
  redirection. This is not supported in the PHP4 object model. Please upgrade to PHP5.
  
  7) Path to favicon.ico not found.
  Domus.Link now requires PHP5+.
  
  8) With version 2.0, the REST API code creates a cache that may need to be removed when upgrading.
  This file is ni the root directory of the web install of domus.Link and is urlCache.map. You should
  remove this file after upgrading or the API commands may not be properly found or are returning HTTP
  errors.
  
  9) Issue starting and stopping heyu within domus.Link or through the command line after a good configuration.
  		Here some background information for domus.Link and heyu start/stop:

		Linux/Unix specific definition: the owner of a running process is the one that can control it directly.
		Otherwise, permissions in linux/unix need to be granted. Root mostly has control over all, but running
		as root is always not recommended.

		domus.Link specific definition: domus.Link requires both the heyu relay and engine to be running to
		function. By default, if the engine is not running and the relay is, domus will try to start it.
		If neither are running, it will try to start both. This is when the 'start' button is selected.

		heyu specific definition: in the x10.conf file, there is a parameter to auto start the heyu engine.
		If this is 'start_engine AUTO', when heyu is started it will bring up both the relay and the engine.
		Otherwise, just the relay is started.

		apache specific definition: in most linux/unix systems, the webserver is run under a  specific user id
		such as 'apache'. This is not a root level id and has access only to the items given permission by the
		user creation. This would be similar to a normal user in the system.

		Scenario 1:
		So, if user 'brad' starts heyu and the x10.conf file does not have AUTO for start_engine, there will
		be one process owned by 'brad' called 'heyu_relay'.

		Then the apache webserver starts under user id 'apache'. A user loads the domus.Link page and it says
		that hey is not running. The user selects the 'start' from the web page, and then it comes back saying
		heyu is still not running.

		Problem: Since 'brad' started heyu_relay and apache wants to start the 'heyu_engine' the heyu relay
		denies another process owner to start the second process as they both have to be the same owner, which
		in this case is 'brad'.

		Scenario 2:
		So, if user 'brad' starts heyu and the x10.conf file does have AUTO for start_engine, there will be
		two process owned by 'brad' called 'heyu_relay and 'heyu_engine'.

		Then the apache webserver starts under user id 'apache'. A user loads the domus.Link page and it says
		that hey is running. The user selects the 'stop' from the web page, and then it comes back saying heyu
		is still running.

		Problem: Since 'brad' started heyu_relay and heyu engine and apache wants to stop the 'heyu_engine'
		and the heyu relay, the system denies another process owner to stop the second process as they both
		have to be the same owner, which in this case is 'brad'.

		The moral of he story is, to keep control consistent for domus.Link, it  is best that the heyu processes
		are running under the apache user id. Then domus.Link has full control.
