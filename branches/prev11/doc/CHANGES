  v1.1 - 4/Apr/2010
 ------
 	* Added ability to select a null on one side of a timer i.e.: on or off
 	  but not both.
	* Added Shutter category and module type.
	* Added Other category and module type. (irrigation category was left alone)
	* Added dawn/dusk capability to timers.
	* Added Advanced timers page. This page allows editing timers by selecting
	  the specific macros and all options for timers identified in heyu 2.8.0.
	  This page does not create macros as the simple timer page does.
	* Added a macro edit page. Allows the creation of macros in domus.Link.
	* Added ability to manage heyu configurations based on the constructs of heyu's
	  default -0 thru -9 handling or explicit -c config paths. If -c config path is
	  used, the -0 thru -9 command pass thru is disabled. domus.Link does not currently
	  support starting multiple heyu instances at this time.
	* Updated Trigger page to view and select macros as they are defined.
	* Updated schedule file handling to be object based. The schedule file no longer
	  requires a custom layout as was needed previously. Any valid heyu schedule file
	  will be acceptable.
	* Updated view pages (marco, timer, trigger) enable/disable to now be in the action
	  column.
	* Updated db file for floorplan to be named floorplan-dist so as not to overwrite users
	  current floorplan file.
	* Fixed issue 2 - error output of utility exection should stay in the utility output
	  window.
	* Fixed issue 4 - drop down list widths would cut off text in list. udpated all drop
	  downs to be wider.
	* Fixed issue 5 - updated domus.Link module list from heyu modlist in 2.8.0.
