 Requirements:
 --------------
 To run and use domus.Link you need the following:
 
 - Heyu
 - Apache or any other webserver
 - PHP support
 
 
 Assumptions:
 --------------
 The following install procedure assumes the following:
 
 - Heyu is NOT running ($ [sudo] heyu stop )
 - Heyu configuration files are located in /etc/heyu
 - Heyu binary is located in /usr/local/bin
 - Websever root folder is /var/www
 - And domus.Link is being installed in /var/www/domus.Link
 
 
 Installation:
 --------------
 
 Note: Some commands that are shown may require root priveleges. Either become root on your system
 or pre-pend the command with sudo.

 1) Download latest version from http://domus.link.co.pt/download

 2) If upgrading from a previous version of domus.Link, backup existing domus.Link files for safety. (VERY IMPORTANT)

    $ cp [your web path]/domus.Link/config.php [backup location]/config.php.backup
    
 3) Un-tar to a location within the webserver root or a specific directory.
 
 	These instructions show that /var/www is the web path for your server.
 
    $ mv domuslink-XXX.tar.gz /var/www
    $ cd /var/www
    $ tar xfvz domuslink-XXX.tar.gz

 4) Change file permission's so that webserver can read/write to the following files/dirs:
    - /etc/heyu
    - /var/www/domus.Link/db/ 
    - /var/www/domus.Link/config.php
    
    $ chmod o+rw /etc/heyu /var/www/domus.Link/db /var/www/domus.Link/config.php

 5) If upgrading from previous version, copy back backed up config.php.
 
 	$ cp [your backup location]/config.php.backup [your web path]/domus.Link/config.php
 
 6) Setup apache accordingly, refer to http://httpd.apache.org if you don't
    know how to do this.
    
 7) Finally, point your web browser to your webserver (ie: http://localhost/domus.Link)
    and start heyu using the 'START' link located on the footer.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The next step might not be required, however, if you keep getting a
 "HEYU: Can't open TTY line. check permissions!" then please follow it.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------


 X) Change permission on TTY port so that heyu can use it.
    
    The typically used port is /dev/ttyS0 which is usually a sym. link to
    /dev/tts/0 so in this case use the following command:
    
    $ chmod o+rw /dev/tts/0
    
    To check where /dev/ttyS0 links to, issue the following command:
    
    $ ls -l /dev/ttyS0
