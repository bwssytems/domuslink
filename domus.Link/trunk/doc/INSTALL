 It is assumed that you already have Heyu installed and running. If not refer
 to http://heyu.org for heyu packages and install information.

 1) Download latest package.

 2) Un-tar to a location within the webserver root or a specific directory.

 3) Backup your x10.conf file!!! (VERY IMPORTANT)

 4) Copy supplied x10.conf file to location of your x10.conf file,
    usually in /etc/heyu.
    (The supplied x10.conf file is prepared for use with the frontend)
    ie: cp x10.conf /etc/heyu/x10.conf

 5) Edit supplied x10.conf file and change TTY directive to suit
    your system.
    - Do not add tabs, or extra spaces between options and directive.
    - Leave everything else as is.

 6) Change x10.conf file permissions so that webserver can change it.
    ie: chown apache:apache /etc/heyu/x10.conf
    or: chmod +rw /etc/heyu/x10.conf

 7) Change config.php file permissions so that webserver can change it.
    ie: chown apache:apache config.php
    or: chmod +rw config.php

 8) Edit config.php to suit your needs, or use the frontend to do so.

 The next step might not be required, however, if you keep getting a
 "HEYU: Can't open TTY line. check permissions!" then please follow it.

 X) Change permission on TTY port so that webserver can use it.
    ie: chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS0
    on slackware: chmod o+rw /dev/tts/0


 Finally, point your web browser to you webserver. If you placed it in the root
 folder http://localhost should suffice.
