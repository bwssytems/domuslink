 It is assumed that you already have Heyu installed and running. If not refer
 to http://heyu.org for heyu packages and install information.

 1) Download latest package.

 2) Un-tar to a location within the webserver root or a specific directory.

 3) Backup your x10.conf file!!! (VERY IMPORTANT)

 4) Copy supplied x10.conf file to location of your x10.conf file,
    usually in /etc/heyu.
    (The supplied x10.conf file is prepared for use with the frontend)

 5) Edit supplied x10.conf file and change TTY directive to suit
    your system.
    - Do not add tabs, or extra spaces between option and directive.
    - Leave everything else as is.

 5) Change permissions on config.php file to either 777 or
    web server user and group.
    ie: chmod 777 config.php or chmod apache:apache config.php

 6) Edit config.php to suit your needs, or use the frontend to do so.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The next step will probably not be required, however if you keep getting
 a "HEYU: Can't open TTY line. check permissions!" then please follow it.

 X) Change permission on TTY port so that webserver user can use it.
    ie: chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS0
    on slackware: chmod o+rw /dev/tts/0
