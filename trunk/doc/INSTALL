 Requirements:
 --------------
 To run and use domus.Link you need the following:
 
 - Heyu
 - Apache or any other webserver
 - PHP support
 
 
 Assumptions:
 --------------
 The following install procedure assumes the following:
 
 - Heyu is NOT running ($ [sudo] heyu stop )
 - Heyu configuration files are located in /etc/heyu
 - Heyu binary is located in /usr/local/bin
 - Websever root folder is /var/www
 - And domus.Link is being installed in /var/www/domus.Link
 
 
 Installation:
 --------------
 
 Note: Some commands that are shown may require root priveleges. Either become root on your system
 or pre-pend the command with sudo.

 1) Download latest version from http://domus.link.co.pt/download

 2) If upgrading from a previous version of domus.Link, backup existing domus.Link files for safety. (VERY IMPORTANT)

    $ cp [your web path]/domus.Link/config.php [backup location]/config.php.backup
    
    This step is optional. V1.1 will not overwrite your current floorplan file.
    
    $ cp -r [your web path]/domus.Link/db [backup location]/dbbackup

 3) Un-tar to a location within the webserver root or a specific directory.
 
 	These instructions show that /var/www is the web path for your server.
 
    $ mv domuslink-XXX.tar.gz /var/www
    $ cd /var/www
    $ tar xfvz domuslink-XXX.tar.gz

 4) Backup existing x10.conf & x10.sched files (VERY IMPORTANT if new installation)

    $ cp /etc/heyu/x10.conf /etc/heyu/x10.conf.backup
    $ cp /etc/heyu/x10.sched /etc/heyu/x10.sched.backup

 5) Copy supplied x10.conf file to heyu configuration directory (VERY IMPORTANT if new installation)
    
    $ cp /var/www/domus.Link/doc/x10.conf /etc/heyu/x10.conf

    The supplied x10.conf file is prepared for use with the 
    frontend and therefore must be used. The x10.conf file
    supplied with Heyu will not work with domus.Link. This is due
    to domus.Link requiring all directives to be uppercase.
    
    Since V1.1 the x10.scehd file parsing is now heyu compatible.

 6) Edit x10.conf file and change TTY directive to suit your system.
    - Do not add tabs, or extra spaces between options and directives.
    - Do not add comments, or any other text.
    - Leave everything else as is.
    
    $ vi /etc/heyu/x10.conf

 7) Change file permission's so that webserver can read/write to the following files/dirs:
    - /etc/heyu
    - /var/www/domus.Link/db/floorplan 
    - /var/www/domus.Link/config.php
    
    $ chmod o+rw /etc/heyu /var/www/domus.Link/db/floorplan /var/www/domus.Link/config.php

 8) If upgrading from previous version, copy back backed up config.php.
 
 	$ cp [your backup location]/config.php.backup [your web path]/domus.Link/config.php
 
    Otherwise, if this is a new installation, copy the floorplan-dist file.
    
    $ cp [your web path]/domus.Link/db/floorplan-dist [your web path]/domus.Link/db/floorplan

 9) Setup apache accordingly, refer to http://httpd.apache.org if you don't
    know how to do this.
    
 10) Finally, point your web browser to your webserver (ie: http://localhost/domus.Link)
    and start heyu using the 'START' link located on the footer.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The next step might not be required, however, if you keep getting a
 "HEYU: Can't open TTY line. check permissions!" then please follow it.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------


 X) Change permission on TTY port so that heyu can use it.
    
    The typically used port is /dev/ttyS0 which is usually a sym. link to
    /dev/tts/0 so in this case use the following command:
    
    $ chmod o+rw /dev/tts/0
    
    To check where /dev/ttyS0 links to, issue the following command:
    
    $ ls -l /dev/ttyS0
